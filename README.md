# A simple personal site #

Hi, this is the code of my personal site. Really It's quite simple and it was made with HTML, CSS (SCSS) and some JavaScript, but inside it there are some features that maybe could interest you:

* I've used [CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) (and its fallbacks).
* For the classes names I've followed [BEM methodology](http://getbem.com/)
* The CSS has been compiled under [ITCSS architecture](https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/)

So if you want to see the code, try it or reuse for another project, feel free to do it :wink:

# How to run this #

Well, this is quite old school :grimacing:

1. Copy the files in your machine,
2. and open the index.html in your favourite browser.

Easy, isn't it?
