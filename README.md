# A simple personal site #

Hi, this is the code of my personal site. Really It's quite simple and it was made with HTML, CSS (SCSS) and some JavaScript, but inside it there are some features that maybe could interest you:

* I've used CSS custom properties (and its fallbacks).
* For the classes names I've followed BEM methodology
* The CSS has been compiled under ITCSS architecture
