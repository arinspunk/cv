Hi,

my name is Xulio, I live in Sevilla (Spain) and this is my personal website.


This site is made with:

- HTML5
- CSS3 (through SCSS)
- a bit of Javascript.


I built it with the help of:

- SublimeText 3, to write the code
- node-sass and Minify, to compile the SCSS and minify the CSS
- Firefox and Chrome, to testing and debuging
- Github, for the repo
- GitHub Desktop, to the development workflow
- Plesk, to manage the server


The font used is SawtonÂ© (beautiful!), from Atipo Foundry:

- Font: https://www.atipofoundry.com/fonts/sawton
- License: https://www.atipofoundry.com/license


If you want to see all the code, try it or reuse for another project, you can visit the repo: 

- https://github.com/arinspunk/cv

It's under GNU GPLv3 license, except the font, that is under its own license (https://www.atipofoundry.com/license). If you want use it you need to buy it (https://www.atipofoundry.com/fonts/sawton).
