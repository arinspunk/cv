# Solution Protocol (KISS Principle)
Analyze requirement → propose simplest viable solution → .cursor/memory/ as `YYYYMMDD-VV-solution-description.md`
- VV = daily sequence (01, 02...)
- Prioritize: simplicity, maintainability, minimal dependencies
- Include: problem summary, proposed approach, implementation steps, trade-offs
- KISS first: avoid over-engineering, choose proven patterns
- Auto-save after proposal completion
