# Analysis Protocol
Analyze @file, @folder, or code selection → save to .cursor/memory/ as `YYYYMMDD-VV-description.md`
- VV = daily sequence (01, 02...)
- Include: architecture, patterns, dependencies, issues, recommendations
- Auto-save after analysis completion

## Critical rule
⚠️ **NEVER skip memory save** - even for "quick looks" or simple requests. The protocol exists to maintain project knowledge consistency.
